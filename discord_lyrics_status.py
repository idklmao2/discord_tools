Why you mad, why you mad? Why you mad, why you mad?
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade, like a dick in your throat
Well, if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
